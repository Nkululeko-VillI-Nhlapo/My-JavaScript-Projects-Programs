A South African (SA) telephone number validator is a tool or function that checks whether a given input 
string(of numbers) conforms to the format of a valid South African phone number. South African phone 
numbers have specific formats, whether they are local or mobile numbers, and they may also be in 
international format.

#Html provides the platform and the structure, while css provides color and user friendly
#interface, and js provides the functionality and the logic of the application.

> In the JavaScript code provided, we have implemented a SA telephone number validator by defining 
regular expression patterns that match valid South African phone number formats. These patterns 
cover both local and mobile numbers, as well as numbers in international format.

>Here's how the JavaScript code works:

1. Event Listeners: 
We add event listeners to the "check" and "clear" buttons. When the "check" button is clicked, 
the validatePhoneNumber function is called, and when the "clear" button is clicked, the clearResults 
function is called.

2. validatePhoneNumber Function:
> Retrieves the user input from the input field and the results div element.
> Trims the input to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
> Clears any previous results from the results div.
> Checks if the input is empty. If it is, an alert is shown to prompt the user to provide a phone number.
> Defines regular expression patterns for valid South African phone numbers. These patterns cover both local and mobile numbers, as well as international format numbers.
> Uses the some method to check if the input matches any of the valid patterns.
> Updates the results div with a message indicating whether the phone number is valid or invalid. It 
also applies a corresponding CSS class (valid or invalid) for styling purposes.

3. clearResults Function:
> Clears the text content and class name of the results div, effectively resetting it to its initial 
state. 

> This implementation allows users to input a South African phone number, and upon clicking the 
"check" button, the validator checks if the input follows the valid SA phone number formats. If it does,
 a message indicating that the number is valid is displayed. Otherwise, a message indicating that the 
 number is invalid is shown. The "clear" button allows users to reset the results and input fields for 
 a fresh validation process.
