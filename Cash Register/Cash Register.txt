This JavaScript code implements a simple purchase transaction system for a retail application. 
It takes user input for the price of an item and the cash amount provided by the customer. Based on 
these inputs, it calculates the change due to the customer and determines the denominations of coins 
and notes to give back as change.

Here's how the JavaScript code works:

1. Event Listener: 
When the DOM content is loaded, the script attaches an event listener to the "Purchase" button.

2. calculateChange Function: 
This function is called when the "Purchase" button is clicked. It performs  the following tasks:

> Prompts the user to enter the price of the item in Rands (South African currency).
> Retrieves the cash amount provided by the customer from the input field.
> Calculates the total change due to the customer by subtracting the price from the cash amount, after 
converting both to cents for accurate calculations.
> Checks if the change is negative, indicating that the customer did not provide enough cash. If so, it 
displays an alert message.
> If the change is zero, indicating that the customer paid with exact cash, it displays a message 
indicating no change is due.
> If the change is positive, it calls the getChangeStatus function to determine the denominations of 
coins and notes to give back as change.
getChangeStatus Function: This function takes the total change due and the cash in the drawer 
(cid array) as input. It iterates through the cid array, starting from the highest denomination, and
 calculates the number of coins or notes to give as change. It then updates the changeStatus string 
 with the denominations and amounts of change to be given back. If there's insufficient change in the 
 drawer, it returns a status indicating so. Finally, it returns the formatted changeStatus string.

> Overall, this JavaScript code provides a functional and interactive interface for handling purchase 
transactions in a retail setting, with specific considerations for the South African context.
