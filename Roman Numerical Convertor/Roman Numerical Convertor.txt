A Roman numeral converter is a tool or application that converts numbers between the Roman numeral 
system and the Arabic numeral system (which is the standard numeric system used today). 
> Converts 10 to X

>The convertor is made with HTML,CSS, AND JS, it is interactive and fits with any screen

#Html provides the platform and the structure, while css provides color and user friendly
#interface, and js provides the functionality and the logic of the application.
Here is the break down of the JS Code:
1. Data Structure:
> romanNumerals Array: This array contains objects that map Arabic values to their corresponding Roman 
numerals. Each object has a value (an Arabic number) and a numeral (the corresponding Roman numeral).

2. Function:
> arabicToRoman Function: This function converts an Arabic number (integer) into a Roman numeral string.
> Input Validation: The function first checks if the input number is less than or equal to 0 or greater 
than or equal to 4000. If so, it returns an error message.
> Conversion Logic: The function initializes an empty string (result). It then iterates through the 
romanNumerals array, appending the corresponding Roman numeral to result and subtracting the value 
from the input number until the number is reduced to zero.

3. Event Listener:
> Button Click Event Listener: This part adds an event listener to the "Convert" button.
> Input Handling: When the button is clicked, it reads the value from the input field with the ID number.
> Validation Check: If the input is empty, it displays an error message.
> Conversion and Output: It converts the input number to an integer, calls the arabicToRoman function 
with this number, and displays the result in the div with the ID output.

4. Summary:
> The code takes an Arabic number input from the user, validates it, converts it to a Roman numeral 
if it is within the valid range, and displays the result. If the input is invalid, it shows an 
appropriate error message.
